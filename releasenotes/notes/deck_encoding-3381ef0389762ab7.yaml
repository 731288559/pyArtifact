    Deck encoding is now supported
features:
  - |
    :py:func:`decode_deck_string` and :py:func:`encode_deck`
    are now available, to encode and decode deck strings. It's wrapper
issues:
  - |
    Encoding and decoding isn't very readable at the moment and could use a ton of pythonization ;)
  - |
    :py:class:`Deck` - a wrapper for encoding and decoding still needs tons of design work.
    The question is whether this library should be a deck building tool, or just a lightweight wrapper,
    more focused on reporting the decks and more 'low level' edits through dictionaries that are used internally.
